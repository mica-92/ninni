Personal Statement&nbsp;¶ Buenos Aires, 2019
My geological call came on a very lucky trip to Disney World, Florida. The trip involved traveling to the Northern Hemisphere for the first time in my life, and my excitement to meet Mickey was equally in degree with that of a 5-year-old - although I was almost a decade older - and by happenstance, I end up staying in a hotel that shaped my life forever."/>

<p><em>Buenos Aires, 2019</em></p>
<p>My geological call came on a very lucky trip to Disney World, Florida. The trip involved traveling to the Northern Hemisphere for the first time in my life, and my excitement to meet Mickey was equally in degree with that of a 5-year-old - although I was almost a decade older - and by happenstance, I end up staying in a hotel that shaped my life forever. The Wilderness Lodge is a replica of the Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park and it turned out to be a geology-themed hotel. Not only did it have a stratigraphic section of the Grand Canyon in the lobby, but it also featured an artificial geyser - Copper Creek Spring - right beside the pool, among other geological rarities. I simply couldn’t believe my eyes, I was in awe with every single detail. Needless to say, I took the hotel tour three times! Upon returning home to Argentina, I was eager to find more about this new world; so I decided to contact Yellowstone National Park. At the same time, I was in limbo deciding what I was going to study as an undergraduate. A couple of months later a reply came in the form of a bunch of books and brochures that I still treasure. Reading about magma chamber, seismic activity and possible super- calderas hooked me in this magical journey, a magical journey that years later I am still exploring.</p>
<p>Now with my undergraduate degree only months away, I once more reaffirm and commit to learn about geology. Geology is one of those enthralling sciences that shape the way you perceive the world: We no longer see kitchen counters, we see granite intrusions and taking hikes in the mountains transform into windows to the past, becoming spectators to the endless motion of plates. As geologists we appreciate time in a new way, understanding processes as events that take millions of years, reading on a deeper level how transitory our life is in this wonderful blue dot at the corner of the Milky Way, contemplating the splendor of nature and how everything changes, although we might not be there to witness it first hand.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to pursuing my doctoral program in this staggering science while expanding and finding new areas of research, refreshing the curious mind that put me on this path in the first place. My undergraduate education was expansive enough to present me with different areas inside geology and my senior thesis was on the topic of ore deposits and the processes involved in their formation. This approach has allowed me to work with concepts inside geochemistry, tectonics and structural geology and be able to integrate concepts and understand the complexity of natural systems. Since the beginning I was always drawn to aspects relating to geochemistry, geology, and cosmology, trying to focus my elective subjects in these areas. Elements and everything surrounding them (deposition, mineral and material formation, complexes, etc) still spark as much inquisitiveness as the first day.</p>
<p>While visiting the University of Pennsylvania this past summer I was happy to find a school where I could see myself growing not only professionally but personally. On that day I was able to meet with Dr. Goldsby and Dr. Jerolmack, as well as other Ph.D. students. The kindness of the whole team was heartwarming, and being an international student this was a fact that struck me dearly. While talking with Dr. Goldsby, his area of research, particularly ice deformation and its implications in icy planetary dynamics resonated with me. This flourishing field has plenty of engaging subjects and mysteries to work on. Ice mechanics research has been going since after world war II, with renewing interest at the end of the 20th century with concerns of global warming and climatology. As space technology gets more advanced we find ice to be of primordial importance. Not only is extremely plentiful, NASA estimates just in the Oort cloud trillions of icy objects, but it may be the key to extraterrestrial life. Ice has proven to be found in the least expected places (such as Mercury) and its behavior and composition, as diverse as the bodies themselves. The topic is as broad as it is engaging, and it is for this reason that I believe the University of Pennsylvania is the school I want to commit to as it will help me flesh out my education and keep growing in this captivating topic.</p>
