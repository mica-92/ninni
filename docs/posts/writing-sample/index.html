<p><em>María Micaela Ninni ⚬ Buenos Aires, Argentina ⚬ December 2019</em></p>
<p>As Joni Mitchel famously sang at Woodstock, <em>‘We are stardust’</em>. Our current understanding of how the elements that compose all the matter surrounding us is inexorably linked to the birth and death of stars. Nucleosynthesis is the process that describes the production, on a cosmic scale, of all the species of chemical elements from perhaps one or two simple types of atomic nuclei, hydrogen, and helium, created at the Big Bang. Almost all other elements have been created by stars, making Mitchell’s statement true.</p>
<p>Since the very beginning of our human species’ endeavor, we have wondered about the components and origin of our reality. The first ideas on nucleosynthesis were simply that chemical elements were created at the beginning of the universe, but it was not until after World War II that nuclear fission was understood and a physical scenario started developing.</p>
<p>Nucleosynthesis models come from three separate lines of evidence. Firstly - and most important - the composition of our solar system. Secondly, experiments on nuclear reactions under set conditions in the laboratory. And lastly, theoretical constraints on possible sites or environments for these nucleosynthetic reactions to take place.</p>
<p>The knowledge of relative abundance of elements in the Solar System, shown in Figure 1, comes from several sources. Through the study of spectroscopic data of the Sun and other stars, as well as studying rock samples - not only from Earth but also from other extraterrestrial bodies like meteorites and lunar samples - the modern notion for element formation started taking shape.</p>

</p>
<p><em>Figure 1. The abundance of elements in the Solar System, logarithmic scale. Source: Wikimedia commons</em></p>
<p>A simple analysis of Figure 1 shows fundamental truths about the composition on the Universe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrogen and helium are the most abundant elements, composing over 99% of the Universe.</li>
<li>Li, Be and B have anomaly low abundances, while Fe and Pb are relatively high</li>
<li>There is an alternation of abundance according to whether elements have an even or odd atomic number.</li>
<li>There is a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier, especially after atomic number 26.</li>
<li>The largest atomic number is that of Uranium, 92.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the late 1950s, the B2FH nucleosynthesis theory was presented. Its name is an acronym of its authors Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler, and Hoyle, whom were awarded the Physics Nobel Prize in 1983 for the theory and other contributions to experimental physics. Within this model, which has been greatly expanded since its publication, there are three categories of nuclide production: cosmological, stellar, and explosive. The first one is associated with the Big Bang and the first events in the formation of the Universe, while the remaining two are associated with stars, their births, and deaths. A fourth category of nuclide formation was added later and is associated with cosmic rays and their interaction with matter - galactic nucleosynthesis. All of these will be discussed in the following sections (the chemical reactions involved are presented in Appendix 1).</p>

<p><em>Formation of H, He and minor quantities of Li</em></p>
<p>Also known as primordial nucleosynthesis. These are the processes associated with the formation of matter at the very first stages of the Universe. A schematic sequence of the events following the Big Bang theory are presented in Figure 4.</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">

</p>
</p>
<p><em>Figure 4. A simplified version of the events occurring right after the Big Bang. Source: Encyclopædia Britannica.</em></p>
<p>After the first nanoseconds after the Big Bang (Figure 4.1), a dense “soup” of subatomic particles, quarks and leptons, and their antiparticle equivalents, condensed from energy. The collision between particles and antiparticles, and their annihilation, led to the primacy of matter over antimatter (Figure 4.2). As the Universe expanded and temperatures drop quarks united to form neutrons and protons. During this time the number of protons and neutrons were equivalent, but the decay experienced by neutrons outside the nucleus created a disequilibrium and with time protons became more abundant, leading to the ratio of 7:1 ratio observed at present (4.3).</p>
<p>It was not until 3.5 minutes (4.4) had passed that temperatures dropped down to 1010 K (due to the Universe expansion) that hydrogen nuclei formed. This hydrogen started to combine forming 3He and then 4He. Approximately 24% of the mass present was converted to 4He and less than 0.01% to 2H, 3He, 7Li. The formation of heavier elements was inhibited by the instability of atoms with masses of 5 and 8, due to a barrier existing at 7Li. Once you try to add another proton to 7Li, radioactive decay ends up producing helium again, coming back down to lighter isotopes, Figure 5.</p>

<p>Around 300.000 years later electrons could merge with the protons, favoring neutral hydrogen, while recent studies have placed the formation of the first galaxies around 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang (4.5) (Tanaka et. al, 2019).</p>

<h2 id="stellar-nucleosynthesis" class="anchor-link"><a href="#stellar-nucleosynthesis">Stellar nucleosynthesis<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p><em>Formation of elements up until 56Fe</em>
Due to the barrier presented in the previous section, elements up to 7 atomic masses can be explained through cosmological nucleosynthesis. All heavier elements need stars to form, and this was the big breakthrough of the B2FH hypothesis.
Before proceeding to the explanation of the processes of stellar and explosive nucleosynthesis there some important concepts to keep in mind.
The first concept is associated with the binding energy of the nucleus for the different elements, as shown in Figure 6. The binding energy presented by 56Fe is the tipping point in this diagram. Elements to the left of 56Fe - with a smaller atomic mass - prefer to combine through fusion reactions in which energy is emitted, by coming together and forming more stable nuclei. This process is the main fuel of stars, and the formation of elements through this mechanism is known as stellar nucleosynthesis. As binding energies become smaller when moving to the right of the diagram, fusion cannot proceed above 56Fe and other mechanisms begin to take place. The right-hand side region is called the neutron- capture and the process of formation of all these elements happen as part of explosive nucleosynthesis processes.</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">

</p>
</p>
<p><em>Figure 6. Nuclear binding energies, shown as a function of atomic mass number. Source: Encyclopædia Britannica</em></p>
<p>The second concept is associated with our element factories - stars. Stars shine due to exothermic reactions that take place within their cores, which create elements up until the 56Fe threshold.</p>
<p>Stars are classified according to their color and spectral lines, which themselves are correlated with their temperatures. The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram shown in Figure 7, plots the relationship between luminosity and surface temperature. About 90 percent of the stars in the Universe, including the Sun, are main-sequence stars, meaning they fuse hydrogen atoms to form helium atoms at their cores. These stars can range from about a tenth of the mass of the Sun to up to 200 times as massive. The mass is in direct relationship with the star’s life span and their fate once all the hydrogen fuel is consumed. The remaining 10 percent that fall outside the main sequence are mostly giants and supergiants whose life will end in one of the most spectacular natural events, a supernova explosion.</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">

</p>
</p>
<p><em>Figure 7. The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of the relationship between luminosity and surface temperature. Source: Encyclopædia Britannica.</em></p>
<p>Back to element formation. Approximately 0.5 - 1.0 billion years after the Big Bang inhomogeneities in the gas cloud formed during the first stages of the Universe, gave rise to the first protogalaxies and that in turn eventually gave rise to the first stars. The deuterium, 2H, burning process starts once temperatures reach 106 K, taking place while the stars are still accreting mass and temporarily stabilizing it against further collapse, a process that can continue for several million years.</p>
<p>As deuterium is exhausted, the core reaches a high enough temperature to ignite the PP process, also known as the hydrogen-burning stage, which continues through the main sequence life of the star. Although there are several reactions by which this can take place, described in Appendix 1, the net result is the production of 4He and the consumption of H and to a lesser extent Li.</p>
<p>The second or older generation of stars can also produced He from another set of processes named CNO  (carbon-nitrogen-oxygen) cycle and theoretical models show that this cycle is the dominant source of energy generation for stars with 12% more mass than the Sun. The CNO Cycle, as its name implies, needs C to be ignited. Carbon works as a catalyst being neither produced nor consumed. What results from the CNO cycle is the production of a neutrino, some energy, and a 4He nucleus (similar to the PP process), by consuming four hydrogen nuclei (protons) and two positrons.</p>
<p>Both processes, PP and CNO, compete in main-sequence stars and their dominance is associated with the star’s temperature. In a sun-size star, the PP reactions account for about 98–99% of the energy production, with the CNO cycle producing the remainder (White, 2013).</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/ninni/posts/WS8.gif" alt="Elements"  />
</p>
</p>
<p><em>Figure 8. Illustration of the CNO cycle, which operates in the larger second-generation stars. Source: Nobel Prize Website.</em></p>
<p>Once hydrogen is consumed at the stellar core, the star’s temperature to rise. The increase in temperature and density results in the expansion of the star’s exterior and the helium recently produced starts burning as the new source of fuel. New chemical reactions are involved, called triple-alpha (Figure 9), marking the beginning of the star’s red giant phase, Figure 10. The time spent by the star in this chapter is in direct relationship with its mass, it can last for as long as a hundred million years or as little as a few hundred thousand years. The main products are 12C and 16O (through the fusion of 4He with 12C), but minor quantities of 20Ne, 24Mg, and 22Ne can be created too.</p>
<p>Our Sun will become a red giant in about 5.4 billion years. Models have shown that the expanding Sun will grow large enough to encompass the orbit of Mercury, Venus, and maybe even Earth.</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">

</p>
</p>
<p><em>Figure 9. Triple Alpha process, as three He nuclei must collide nearly simultaneously. Source: Wikimedia Commons</em></p>
<p>The next stage is critical for the star’s future. Low-mass stars such as the Sun are unable to create the conditions necessary for heavier fusions to occur ending their days as O-Ne-Mg white dwarf, Figure 10, as their outer envelopes are ejected after the carbon-burning phase.</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/ninni/posts/WS10.png" alt="Elements"  />
</p>
</p>
<p><em>Figure 10. Type of stars and Star Cycle</em></p>
<p>High-mass stars, continue their fusion reactions by burning heavier and heavier elements entering the blue supergiant phase, Figure 10. The cycle continues by burning Carbon, Neon, Oxygen and eventually Silicon, Figure 11a. During these stages, heavier elements are synthesized such as Si, Fe and minor quantities of Mg, Na, Al, P, S, K, among others (see reactions in Appendix 1). All these fusion reactions release huge amounts of energy, as they are all exothermic.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of the star, and therefore its pressure and temperature built at its center, simultaneous reactions can occur creating an onion-like structure as shown in Figure 11b. As explained above, the end of the line is the production of 56Fe. Once the iron group starts building at the star’s core, the star is running out of gas and the whole system is on the verge of collapse.

<h2 id="explosive-nucleosynthesis" class="anchor-link"><a href="#explosive-nucleosynthesis">Explosive nucleosynthesis<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p><em>Or how to build elements heavier than iron</em></p>
<p>To create elements above 56Fe we need a different set of processes that do not involve exothermic or fusion reactions. All these elements are less stable and have lower binding energy than 56Fe as explained above.</p>
<p>Stars have free neutrons flying around with very high amounts of energy, and especially high neutron fluxes occur within supernovas. A supernova is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion and is the final stage in the massive-star cycle. The original body either collapses to a neutron star or black hole, or it is destroyed. Supernovas have extreme luminosities that can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy, before fading over several weeks or months. One of the first written records of a supernova comes from Chinese astronomers in 185 AD. Scriptures suggest it took about eight months to fade from the sky.</p>
<p>Presented below is a small section of the chart of the nuclides, from silver (Ag) all the way to antimony (Sb), Figure 12. When adding a neutron to 109Ag, its mass increases by one creating 110Ag, but as the diagram shows 110Ag is unstable and it radioactively decays (by beta decay, β-) to 110Cd. 110Cd continues being bombarded by neutrons increasing its atomic mass until it reaches 115Cd, which once again is unstable and therefore radioactively decays to 115In. This process, called s (slow), simply continues by adding more and more neutrons to existing nuclei until unstable isotopes are reached and decay rapidly to a new heavier element.</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/ninni/posts/WS12.png" alt="Elements"  />
</p>

<em>Figure 12. The s-process acting in the range from Ag to Sb. Notice gaps between isotopes created by the s- process. Source: Wikimedia Commons</em></p>
<p>The slow delivery of neutrons to existing nuclei can continue until uranium, but it is unable to account for the existence of proton-rich (i.e. 112Sn) or neutron-rich (i.e. 122Sn) isotopes of elements. To get past the barrier where unstable nuclei naturally decay to another element, these nuclei have to be rapidly bombarded with neutrons or hit with protons in stellar environments. Both processes, name R (rapid) and P (proton) respectively, are only possible in supernova scenarios, accounting for the lower abundance of isotopes created by these processes alone, Figure 13. Taking Indium as an example, the ratio between 113In and 113In is 1:19, this is due to the fact that while the former is only generated by the P-process, the latter is created by both S and R-processes.</p>
<p>Figure 13 presents a summary of explosive nucleosynthesis and the creation of elements associated with S, R and P processes.</p>

<p>Lithium, Beryllium, and Boron are not produced by stars or any of their associated processes, but minor quantities of 7Li have been produced through primordial nucleosynthesis processes. The formation of these elements is associated with cosmic ray spallation. Cosmic rays consist mainly of protons that move through space at nearly the speed of light and that interact with interstellar gas, producing gamma rays and these low-abundance elements. The energy produced can be detected by telescopes, as shown in Figure 14, and models suggest cosmic rays are mainly produced in supernova explosions, and to a lesser extent in pulsars and black holes. The interactions involved between the cosmic rays and their surroundings are not fully understood and are currently being studied.</p>

<p>The B2FH model explains through three main processes (Big Bang, stellar fusion and supernova explosion) the formation of all elements in the Universe. No two elements are created equal and each process plays an important contribution in the composition of our Universe.
While writing this paper the news that Betelgeuse, once one of the top 20 brightest stars in the Northern Hemisphere, has been dimming since October came out. This behavior is leading astronomers believe its explosion as a supernova is approaching. Betelgeuse is a star in the Orion constellation about 700 light-years away and is approximately 12 times more massive than the Sun. If Betelgeuse goes supernova, it will be the brightest star in the night-sky for many months and it is possible it will be visible during the day. It presents an excellent time to test hypothesis and gather more information about this element-forming spectacle.</p>
<p>The human body is composed of around 37.2 trillion cells. Each cell is made up of different kinds of molecules, that themselves contain several different types of elements. These elements built into DNA, RNA, enzymes, proteins, hemoglobin and other molecules that are constantly executing an array of functions within your body. Without stars to provide the building blocks, none of our existence would be possible.</p>
