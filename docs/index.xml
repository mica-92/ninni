Personal Statement&amp;nbsp;¶ Buenos Aires, 2019
My geological call came on a very lucky trip to Disney World, Florida. The trip involved traveling to the Northern Hemisphere for the first time in my life, and my excitement to meet Mickey was equally in degree with that of a 5-year-old - although I was almost a decade older - and by happenstance, I end up staying in a hotel that shaped my life forever.</description>

We are stardust, literally.&amp;nbsp;¶ A brief introduction to nucleosynthesis&amp;nbsp;¶ María Micaela Ninni ⚬ Buenos Aires, Argentina ⚬ December 2019
As Joni Mitchel famously sang at Woodstock, ‘We are stardust’. Our current understanding of how the elements that compose all the matter surrounding us is inexorably linked to the birth and death of stars.</description>

      <description>PROFILE&amp;nbsp;¶  Ever since I was a little girl, I was always captivated by nature and natural systems&amp;rsquo; complexity. A crazy journey to Disney and a letter to Yellowstone NP set me on my geological journey almost a decade ago. A journey I&amp;rsquo;m still exploring during my graduate education.
During my undergraduate years, I focused primarily on geochemistry, mineralogy, and the deposition of minerals. My senior thesis was done in the Farallón Negro Volcanic Complex in Catamarca, Argentina.</description>
