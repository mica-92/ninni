As part of my undergraduate research I worked along [Carolina Mendez]() and [Diana Irene Mutti]() in the a complete characterization of a SW portion of Los Viscos Vein in the Farallon Negro Volcanic Complex.

presents a textural analysis of the hydrothermal silica present in a mineralized portion of the Los Viscos Vein, in the Farallón Negro Volcanic Complex, Catamarca, Argentina. This allowed to make new contributions about the genesis of the of the intermediate sulphidation, Au-rich epithermal system. The vein is composed primarily of quartz, carbonates and Mn-oxides, with secondary silver sulfosalt minerals such as  acanthite- argentite, proustite, low sulfides, pyrite, and native elements, gold and silver. The complex spatial relationships between the different silica textures reflect that the current exposition level is within the paleo-zone of boiling upflow.
