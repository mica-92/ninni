I'm Mica (/mēkə/). I am a Ph.D. student in the [Earth and Environmental Science Department](https://earth.sas.upenn.edu/people/maria-micaela-ninni) (EES) at the University of Pennsylvania. I am working as part of Dr. David Goldsby's team in the [ice physics laboratory](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/dgoldsby/), doing research associated with [ice rheology and deformation mechanisms](/ninni/research).

I have a B.S. in Geological Sciences from the University of Buenos Aires, where I focused my elective subjects in [ore deposits and geochemistry](ninni/research/#geologic-geochemical-and-structural-characterization-of-the-los-viscos-vein-in-the-farall%c3%b3n-negro-volcanic-complex/). My area of research geological, geochemical and structural characterization of Los Viscos.

When a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114536697-mica-ninni) does not hide my nose, you can usually find me [crocheting](https://mica-92.github.io/ninni/other/piggy.jpg), practicing [yoga](https://mica-92.github.io/ninni/other/#&gid=1&pid=1), [meditating](https://mica-92.github.io/ninni/other/om.jpg), [writing](https://addhana.com), [designing](https://gohugo.io/) or trying something [new](https://gohugo.io).
